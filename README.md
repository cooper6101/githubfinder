This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was designed to demonstrate my ability to create React applications that interact with apis and use basic client side routing.

You can find a hosted version of this application here: https://cooper6101-github-finder.netlify.app/
